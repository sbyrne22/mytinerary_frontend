# mytinerary_frontend

## Mytinerary API
### Made by Sean Byrne.
### GitHub: https://github.com/sbyrne22/mytinerary_frontend
### Live: https://mytinerary-frontend.herokuapp.com
### Overview
  The perfect place to add and share you itineraries with your party or event goers.
### Deployment
  This site is currently deployed on heroku
### Approach
  I started out by getting authentication working on the front-end, and then getting the 'create' and 'get' routes for itineraries working followed by the delete route. Then added some logic to switch what is seen when a user is logged in or not. I then did some light styling.
### Technical Difficulties
  I had issues formatting the date for to allow the users to easily input data and still allow it to be correctly entered into the database. I also had trouble making a good UI for creating an itinerary.
### Future Implementations
  In the future, I would like to users to have the ability to add sections to the itineraries while creating the itinerary, and give the users; the ability to share their itineraries with other users. I would also like to connect to google calendars api so the users' itineraries can be added to their google calendar.
### Tech Used
  - HTML, CSS, Express, Angular.js, Node.js
  - Text Editor: Atom
  - Postman for testing.
#### Acknowledgments
